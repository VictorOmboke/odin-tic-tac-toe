In this project, the goal was to create a simple game of tic tac toe but the main focus was on using factory functions and modules to prevent any global code.

This project was pretty challenging as this was my first time being introduced to factory functions and modules. The most challenging part of the project was figuring out where to place certain functions. "Does this go in the module for controlling the flow of the game or does this belong in the module that controls the game board?"

One of my biggest breakthroughs during this project was when I realized how simple it was to take one function from one module and use it in another module. I began to make a lot more progress once I realized that.

Overall a solid project for learning how to use factory functions and modules.
